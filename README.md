Python CI/CD Project
This repository demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline for a Python project with:

Pre-commit hooks for automatic code formatting and linting.

GitHub Actions for continuous integration, including:

Linting with flake8

Code formatting check with black

Running tests with pytest

Project Setup
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.12 (or your preferred version)

pip for managing dependencies

Installing Dependencies
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setting Up Pre-commit Hooks
This project uses pre-commit to automatically run code formatting and linting checks before every commit. To set it up:

Install pre-commit:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pre-commit
Install the pre-commit hooks:

bash
Copy
Edit
pre-commit install
Now, every time you commit, the hooks will run to check and auto-fix issues with:

black: Code formatting

flake8: Linting

To run the hooks manually on all files:

bash
Copy
Edit
pre-commit run --all-files
Running the Tests
After setting up, you can run tests using pytest:

bash
Copy
Edit
pytest
This will automatically discover and run any test files (i.e., files that start with test_ or end with _test.py).

CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
How the CI Works
This repository uses GitHub Actions to run the following checks whenever a commit is pushed to the main branch or a pull request is created targeting main:

Checkout code: Pulls the latest code from the repository.

Set up Python: Installs Python 3.11.

Install dependencies: Installs required packages from requirements.txt and additional tools (pytest, flake8, black).

Run Tests: Executes the unit tests using pytest.

GitHub Actions Workflow
The GitHub Actions workflow is defined in .github/workflows/python-ci.yml. The workflow will:

Run the pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality.

Check if the code is properly formatted using black.

Lint the code using flake8.

Run tests using pytest.

If any of the checks fail, the pipeline will stop, and the commit will not be merged.
